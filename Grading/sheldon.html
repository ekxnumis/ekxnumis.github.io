            <p>Developed by Dr. William Herbert Sheldon in 1949, the scale originally applied only to large cents but was later adopted universally for all U.S. coins. It is a **70-point numerical system** where 70 represents a perfect coin and 1 represents the poorest condition. The scale is divided into three primary categories: **Poor (P), About Good (AG), Good (G), Very Good (VG), Fine (F), Very Fine (VF), Extremely Fine (EF), About Uncirculated (AU), and Mint State (MS).**</p>
