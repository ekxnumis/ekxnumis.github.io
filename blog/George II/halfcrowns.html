      <h2 class="title is-3 has-text-primary">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The Halfcrown of <strong>King George II</strong> is a coin steeped in the history of Britain’s
        18th-century monetary reform and artistry. Struck in sterling silver and valued at
        <strong>two shillings and sixpence</strong> (or one-eighth of a pound), it served as one of the
        principal silver denominations in circulation throughout his reign.
      </p>
      <p>
        Issued between <strong>1727 and 1758</strong>, the George II halfcrown underwent several changes
        in portrait, legend, and design, reflecting both the aging monarch and the evolving taste of
        the Georgian era. The coins were minted at the <strong>Royal Mint, London</strong>, and feature the
        work of engravers <strong>John Croker</strong> and later <strong>John Sigismund Tanner</strong>.

      <h2 class="title is-4 has-text-primary">Portrait and Design Evolution</h2>
      <p>
        George II’s halfcrowns were struck with four principal portrait types, reflecting his
        advancing age and artistic developments at the Royal Mint:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Young Head (1727–1739):</strong> Draped and laureate bust facing left, designed by John Croker.
          The reverse displays crowned shields of arms in cruciform style with the Order of the Garter at the center.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Old Head (1746–1758):</strong> By John Sigismund Tanner — a more mature bust of the King,
          emphasizing age and dignity, with a slightly broader portrait.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The reverse design remains largely consistent: four crowned shields representing
        <strong>England, Scotland, Ireland, and Hanover</strong>, arranged around the central badge of the
        <strong>Order of the Garter</strong>. A small rose below the shields indicates issues
        struck from silver recovered from the <strong>South Sea Company</strong> stocks (notably 1746).

  <!-- Historical Context -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="content is-medium has-text-justified">
      <h2 class="title is-4 has-text-primary">Historical Context</h2>
      <p>
        The halfcrown circulated widely throughout the mid-18th century, serving as a vital
        denomination in commerce and trade. During George II’s reign, Britain expanded its empire,
        fought major European wars, and began shaping the monetary stability that would support the
        Industrial Revolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The recoinages of the 1740s improved silver quality and consistency, with the 1746 issues
        being particularly prized for their association with <strong>South Sea silver</strong>.

      <p>
        George II halfcrowns are a cornerstone of 18th-century British numismatics. They offer
        collectors a fascinating glimpse into the artistry of the Royal Mint and the turbulent
        decades of Britain’s imperial expansion. Well-preserved examples, especially the
        <strong>1743 LIMA</strong> and <strong>1746 Rose</strong> issues, are highly sought after
        and command strong prices at auction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each type reflects a story — from war booty and trade silver to the regal portraiture that
        bridged the age of baroque and neoclassical design.
